Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

 

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
 

Constraints:

1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200
num1 and num2 consist of digits only.
Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        n1,n2=0,0
        for i in num1:
            n1 = n1*10 + ord(i)-48
        for i in num2:
            n2 = n2*10 + ord(i)-48
        return str(n1*n2)
