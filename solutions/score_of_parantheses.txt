Given a balanced parentheses string s, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:

() has score 1
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2
Example 4:

Input: s = "(()(()))"
Output: 6
 

Note:

s is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
2 <= s.length <= 50

Solution:
class Solution:
    def scoreOfParentheses(self, S):
        ans = bal = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(S):
            if x == '(':
                bal += 1
            else:
                bal -= 1
                if S[i-1] == '(':
                    ans += 1 << bal
        return ans
